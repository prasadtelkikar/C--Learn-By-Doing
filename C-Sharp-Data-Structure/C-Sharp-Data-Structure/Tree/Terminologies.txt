Root of tree: Root of tree is the node with no parents.
Edges of tree: Edges of tree is link which is used to connect parent to child.
Leaf node: Node with no children is called as leaf node.
Siblings: Nodes having same parent are called as siblings.
Level of Node: Set of all nodes at given depth is called as level of node.
Depth of node: The depth of a node is length of path from root to the node.
Height of Node: Height of node is the length of path from that node to the deepest node.
The height of a tree is the length of path from root to the deepest node in the tree.
Skew trees: If every node in a tree has only one child(except leaf nodes) then we call such trees skew trees.
If every node has only left child, then  we call them left skew tree. If every node has only right child, then we call them right skew tree.

Strict binary tree: A binary tree is called strict binary tree, if each node has exactly two or no children.
Full binary tree: A binary tree is called full binary tree, if each node has exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at same level.
